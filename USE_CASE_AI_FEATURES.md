# 2. Lead Scoring Engine

## Purpose
Automatically calculate a 0-100 score for every lead based on firmographics, behavior, and engagement to help sales teams prioritize.

## Algorithm Details

### Scoring Factors (5 components)

```javascript
LeadScore.calculate(lead) {
  let totalScore = 0
  
  // Factor 1: Engagement Level (0-30 points)
  const activityCount = lead.activities.length
  const engagementScore = Math.min(30, activityCount * 3)
  totalScore += engagementScore
  
  // Factor 2: Source Quality (0-20 points)
  const sourceScores = {
    'referral': 20,      // Highest quality
    'website': 15,       // Inbound interest
    'social_media': 12,  // Engaged audience
    'email': 10,         // Marketing qualified
    'cold_call': 5,      // Outbound
    'other': 5
  }
  totalScore += sourceScores[lead.source] || 5
  
  // Factor 3: Recency (0-20 points)
  const daysSinceCreation = calculateDays(lead.created_at)
  if (daysSinceCreation <= 1) totalScore += 20      // Brand new
  else if (daysSinceCreation <= 3) totalScore += 15 // Very fresh
  else if (daysSinceCreation <= 7) totalScore += 10 // Fresh
  else if (daysSinceCreation <= 14) totalScore += 5 // Recent
  // Older leads get 0 points
  
  // Factor 4: Status/Progress (0-20 points)
  const statusScores = {
    'new': 0,
    'contacted': 5,
    'qualified': 15,
    'proposal': 18,
    'negotiation': 20
  }
  totalScore += statusScores[lead.status] || 0
  
  // Factor 5: Company Size (0-10 points)
  if (lead.company_size === 'enterprise') totalScore += 10
  else if (lead.company_size === 'mid-market') totalScore += 7
  else if (lead.company_size === 'small') totalScore += 5
  else if (lead.company_size === 'startup') totalScore += 3
  
  return Math.min(100, totalScore) // Cap at 100
}
```

### Real-World Example

**Lead: Sarah Johnson from Acme Corp**

```javascript
{
  name: "Sarah Johnson",
  company: "Acme Corp",
  title: "VP of Sales",
  email: "sarah@acme.com",
  source: "referral",           // +20 points
  created_at: "2 days ago",     // +15 points (recent)
  status: "qualified",          // +15 points (progressed)
  company_size: "enterprise",   // +10 points
  activities: [
    "Downloaded whitepaper",
    "Attended webinar",
    "Replied to email",
    "Opened 3 emails",
    "Visited pricing page 2x"
  ]                             // 5 activities = +15 points (min(30, 5*3))
}

Total Score: 20 + 15 + 15 + 10 + 15 = 75/100
Classification: HOT LEAD 🔥
```

## Score-Based Actions (Automatic)

```javascript
// After score is calculated, trigger actions:

if (score >= 75) {
  // HOT LEAD
  lead.priority = "urgent"
  lead.assigned_to = seniorSalesRep
  
  Task.create({
    title: `URGENT: Call hot lead ${lead.name}`,
    due_date: "within_4_hours",
    priority: "urgent"
  })
  
  Notification.send({
    to: salesManager,
    message: `New hot lead scored ${score}`,
    action: "Review immediately"
  })
  
  AIInsight.create({
    type: "lead_score",
    title: "High-Priority Lead Identified",
    description: `${lead.name} scored ${score}/100 - High conversion probability`,
    priority: "high",
    action_recommended: "Schedule demo call within 24 hours"
  })
}

else if (score >= 50 && score < 75) {
  // WARM LEAD
  lead.priority = "high"
  lead.assigned_to = standardSalesRep
  
  Task.create({
    title: `Follow up with ${lead.name}`,
    due_date: "within_48_hours",
    priority: "high"
  })
}

else {
  // COLD LEAD - Nurture via marketing
  ContactList.add(lead, "Marketing Nurture")
  
  Email.sendSequence({
    to: lead.email,
    sequence: "lead_nurture_6_emails",
    interval: "every_3_days"
  })
}
```

## Continuous Learning

```javascript
// Track prediction accuracy
AIPrediction.create({
  prediction_type: "lead_score",
  entity_type: "lead",
  entity_id: lead.id,
  predicted_value: {score: 75, factors: {...}},
  confidence: 0.85,
  model_version: "v1.0"
})

// When lead converts (or is lost), track outcome
Lead.onConvert(lead_id) {
  prediction = AIPrediction.find({entity_id: lead_id})
  prediction.update({
    actual_value: {converted: true, days_to_convert: 14},
    is_verified: true,
    accuracy_score: calculateAccuracy(predicted, actual)
  })
  
  // Model learns: High-scoring leads convert faster ✓
}
```

# 3. Email Assistant

## Purpose
Generate contextual, personalized email drafts in seconds to save time and improve response rates.

## How It Works

### Input Context Analysis

```javascript
EmailAssistant.generateDraft({
  recipient: {
    first_name: "Sarah",
    last_name: "Johnson",
    company: "Acme Corp",
    title: "VP of Sales",
    industry: "Technology"
  },
  purpose: "follow_up",      // or: introduction, proposal, meeting_request
  tone: "professional",      // or: casual, formal
  previous_context: "Spoke at TechCrunch conference last week",
  relationship_stage: "qualified_lead",
  last_interaction: "Webinar attendance 3 days ago"
})
```

### Template Selection Engine

```javascript
// AI selects best template based on context
EmailTemplates = {
  follow_up: {
    professional: {
      subject: "Following up on our conversation",
      body: `Hi {{first_name}},

I wanted to follow up on {{previous_context||"our previous conversation"}}. 

{{#if recent_activity}}
I noticed you {{recent_activity}} - would love to discuss how we can help {{company}} {{achieve_goal}}.
{{/if}}

Would you be available for a brief call {{suggested_time}}?

Best regards,
{{sender_name}}`,
      variables: ["first_name", "company", "previous_context", "suggested_time"]
    }
  },
  
  proposal: {
    professional: {
      subject: "Proposal for {{company}}",
      body: `Hi {{first_name}},

Thank you for taking the time to discuss {{company}}'s needs with me.

Based on our conversation, I've prepared a proposal that outlines how we can help you {{goal}}.

{{#if timeline}}
I understand you're looking to {{timeline}}, so I've structured the proposal to meet that objective.
{{/if}}

I've attached the proposal for your review. I'd be happy to walk you through it at your convenience.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Best regards,
{{sender_name}}`
    }
  }
}
```

### Personalization Engine

```javascript
// Inject dynamic data
Email.personalize(template, context) {
  // Pull recent activities
  const recentActivity = Activity.recent(recipient.id, limit: 1)
  
  // Suggest optimal send time
  const suggestedTime = OptimalSendTime.calculate({
    recipient_timezone: recipient.timezone,
    historical_open_rates: recipient.email_stats,
    day_of_week: "Tuesday or Thursday", // Best for B2B
    time_of_day: "10am or 2pm"          // Peak engagement times
  })
  
  // Personalize subject line
  let subject = template.subject
  subject = subject.replace("{{company}}", recipient.company)
  
  // Personalize body
  let body = template.body
  body = body.replace("{{first_name}}", recipient.first_name)
  body = body.replace("{{company}}", recipient.company)
  
  if (previous_context) {
    body = body.replace("{{previous_context}}", previous_context)
  }
  
  if (recentActivity) {
    body = body.replace("{{recent_activity}}", 
      `attended our webinar on "${recentActivity.title}"`)
  }
  
  return {
    subject,
    body,
    suggested_send_time: suggestedTime,
    personalization_score: 0.9, // High confidence
    confidence: 0.8
  }
}
```

# 4. Next Best Action

## Purpose
Provide personalized, context-aware recommendations for what action to take next with each lead, contact, or deal.

## Decision Engine

### Input Analysis

```javascript
NextBestAction.analyze({
  entity_type: "lead",
  entity_id: lead_id,
  
  // Context factors
  current_stage: lead.status,
  score: lead.score,
  days_since_last_contact: calculateDays(lead.last_contacted),
  engagement_level: lead.engagement_score,
  response_rate: lead.email_response_rate,
  deal_value: lead.potential_value,
  close_probability: lead.ai_close_probability
})
```

### Recommendation Logic

```javascript
// Decision tree
NextBestAction.recommend(context) {
  const recommendations = []
  
  // Rule 1: Stale leads need re-engagement
  if (context.days_since_last_contact > 7) {
    recommendations.push({

      title: "Send Follow-up Email",
      description: `It's been ${context.days_since_last_contact} days since last contact. Re-engage to prevent lead from going cold.`,
      priority: context.score > 70 ? "urgent" : "high",
      confidence: 0.9,
      estimated_impact: "High chance of re-engagement",
      template: "reengagement_email"
    })
  }
  
  // Rule 2: Hot leads need immediate action
  if (context.score > 75 && context.days_since_last_contact < 3) {
    recommendations.push({
      action: "schedule_demo",
      title: "Schedule Product Demo",
      description: "Lead is highly engaged and ready. Schedule demo to move forward.",
      priority: "urgent",
      confidence: 0.85,
      estimated_impact: "60% chance of conversion within 2 weeks",
      suggested_times: getBestMeetingTimes(lead)
    })
  }
  
  // Rule 3: Missing key information
  if (!context.phone || !context.email || !context.budget_confirmed) {
    recommendations.push({
      action: "collect_info",
      title: "Collect Missing Information",
      description: "Complete lead profile to better qualify opportunity.",

      missing_fields: [
        !context.phone && "phone_number",
        !context.budget_confirmed && "budget_confirmation"
      ].filter(Boolean),
      estimated_impact: "Improves qualification accuracy by 30%"
    })
  }
  
  // Rule 4: Engaged but not converting
  if (context.engagement_level > 70 && context.status === "contacted") {
    recommendations.push({
      action: "send_proposal",
      title: "Send Proposal",
      description: "Lead is engaged but hasn't progressed. Send proposal to advance.",
      priority: "high",
      confidence: 0.75,
      estimated_impact: "Move to next stage",
      template: "proposal_template"
    })
  }
  
  // Rule 5: Deal velocity check
  if (context.entity_type === "deal") {
    const daysInStage = calculateDays(context.stage_entry_date)
    const avgDaysInStage = getAverageByStage(context.current_stage)
    
    if (daysInStage > avgDaysInStage * 1.5) {
      recommendations.push({
        action: "escalate_deal",
        title: "Deal Velocity Warning",
        description: `Deal has been in ${context.current_stage} for ${daysInStage} days (avg: ${avgDaysInStage}). Risk of stalling.`,
        priority: "urgent",
        confidence: 0.8,
        estimated_impact: "Prevent deal from going cold",
        suggested_action: "Schedule executive call or apply discount"
      })
    }
  }
  
  // Sort by priority
  recommendations.sort((a, b) => 
    priorityScore(b.priority) - priorityScore(a.priority)
  )
  
  return recommendations[0] // Return top recommendation
}
```

### Real-World Example

**Scenario: Deal stuck in Negotiation stage**

```javascript
// Input
deal = {
  id: "deal-123",
  name: "Acme Corp - Enterprise Plan",
  stage: "negotiation",

      impact: "Medium - Address competitive concerns"
    }
  ],
  
  risk_factors: [
    "Deal stalled for 21 days (2x average)",
    "No activity in 14 days",
    "Close date approaching",
    "Competitor (HubSpot) in play"
  ],
  
  estimated_impact: "Immediate action required to prevent loss",
  
  success_probability: {

# 5. Anomaly Detection

## Purpose
Automatically identify unusual patterns or deviations that require attention.

## Detection Patterns

### 1. Conversion Rate Drop

```javascript
AnomalyDetection.monitorConversionRate() {
  // Current month data
  const currentPeriod = {
    leads_created: 500,
    leads_converted: 40,
    conversion_rate: 8% // 40/500
  }
  
  // Historical baseline
  const baseline = {
    avg_conversion_rate: 15%,
    std_deviation: 2%
  }
  
  // Detect anomaly
  if (currentPeriod.conversion_rate < baseline.avg - (2 * baseline.std_deviation)) {
    AIInsight.create({
      type: "anomaly_detection",
